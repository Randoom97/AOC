# Advent of Code

I started doing advent of code (https://adventofcode.com/) in 2021 after some people at my first job told me about it. Figured it was time I put it up on github.

My typical workflow is to take my input and preprocess it with a text editor into something that python can make use of without string parsing.

Since advent of code is both one time puzzle solving and sort of a race (for those interested) none of this code is well put together.
